- The price elasticity of demand measures how sensitive the quantity demanded is to changes in price
- Given the law of demand: this will normally be negative

- E = 0, demand is perfectly inelastic: for change in price, quantity demanded doesn't change

- -1 < E < 0, demand is inelastic: for changes in price, quantity demanded change less proportionally

- E = -1: demand is unit elastic: proportional change

- E < -1, demand is elastic: for changes in price, quantity demanded change more proportionally

- E = - infinity, demand is perfectly elastic: for changes in price, quantity demanded drops to zero

- Price elasticity depends on the slope of the line and the reference point as well
- For a linear demand curve, since the slope is constant, the curve will have a region of inelasticity followed by unit elastic and then elastic
