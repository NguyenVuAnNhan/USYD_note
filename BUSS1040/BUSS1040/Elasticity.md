- Responsiveness of one variable to a change in another variable
- We are often interested in measuring how a change in one variable affects another
- Elasticity helps by looking at proportional changes
$$E = \frac{\%\Delta y}{\% \Delta x} = \frac{\Delta y / y}{\Delta x /x}  $$
- Two methods: point method and mid-point (arc) method
- Point method: $$E = \frac{\Delta y / y}{\Delta x /x} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.\frac{x}{y}= \frac{dy}{dx}.\frac{x}{y}$$
- Arc method: $$E = \frac{\Delta y / y^m}{\Delta x /x^m} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.\frac{x^m}{y^m}$$
- where $$x^m = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, y^m = \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}$$
