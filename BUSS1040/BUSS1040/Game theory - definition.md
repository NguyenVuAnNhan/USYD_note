- A dominant strategy is a strategy that is optimal for every possible strategy of your rival
	- A weakly dominant strategy gives a payoff that is at least as good as (can be equal to) any other own strategy, for every possible strategy of the opponent
	- A strictly dominant strategy gives a strictly greater payoff than any other strategy
- Nash equilibrium (NE): the players choose the best possible strategy given the strategies of their opponents. No player can benefit from changing own strategy.
