- Cost function is an equation that links the quantity of output with its associated production cost.
- [[Short run production|short-run]]
- Total costs in the short run = total fixed costs  + total variable costs
- Total fixed cost (TFC): costs that in total do not vary with output
- Total variable costs (TVC): costs that change with level of output

- Average fixed cost = AFC = $\frac{TFC}{Q}$
- Average variable cost = AVC = $\frac{TVC}{Q}$
- Average total cost = ATC = $\frac{TC}{Q} = AFC + AVC$
- Marginal cost: the additional cost when producing an extra unit of output
- $MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q} =  \frac{\delta TC}{\delta Q} =  \frac{\delta TVC}{\delta Q}$
