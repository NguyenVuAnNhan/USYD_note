- If a firm choose not to product (q = 0), that firm shuts down
- In the short run, the firm should only take into account its variable costs as fixed costs are sunk
- We define the shut-down condition $TR < VC$
- We can also divide shutdown by level of output $$TR/q < VC/q => p < AVC$$
- Hence, the shut-down rule for a competitive firm is $$P < AVC_{MIN}$$
- On the other hand, a firm will supply a positive quantity when $P \ge AVC_{MIN}$ 
- Hence a firm's short run supply curve is its MC curve that lies above $AVC_{MIN}$
- No entry or exit of firms, the number is fixed in the short run and so the market supply results from horizontal summation of each supply curves
