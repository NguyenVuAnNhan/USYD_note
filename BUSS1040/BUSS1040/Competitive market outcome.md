- The outcome in a competitive market is Pareto efficient
	- For all trades up to the equilibrium point, $MB \ge MC$ 
	- Hence, the consumer is willing to pay more
	- Trading all units up to Q* increases total surplus (increases CS, PS or both)
- At the competitive-market equilibrium, all the potential gains from trade are exhausted
