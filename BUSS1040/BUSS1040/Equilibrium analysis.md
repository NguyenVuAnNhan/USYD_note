- Subgame perfect equilibrium - each players strategy must be a NE in every subgame
	- Threats credible - Strategy would be adopted if needed

- Solve by backward induction
- Identifies the subgame perfect equilibrium so that every players actions are a Nash equilibrium
- Identify credible equilibria by removing non-credible strategies
