- Elasticity can also be applied to supply
- Elasticity of supply measures how sensitive the quantity supplied of a good is to changes in price
- Midpoint method $$E_s = \frac{\Delta q/q_s^m}{\Delta P / P^m} = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta P}.\frac{P^m}{q_s^m}$$
- Point method $$E_s = \frac{\Delta q/q_s}{\Delta P / P} = \frac{dq_s}{dP}.\frac{P}{q_s}$$
- E = 0, perfectly inelastic: any changes in price result in no changes in quantity supplied
- 0 < E < 1, inelastic: changes in price results in less than proportional change in quantity supplied
- E = 1, unit elastic
- E > 1, elastic
- E = infinity, perfectly elastic
