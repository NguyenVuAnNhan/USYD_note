Socially efficient level of output
- MB (value to customers) = MC (cost of production)
	- MB = MC: all gains from trade exhausted
	- welfare (total surplus) maximum, competitive market output Q*

Monopolist
- produces where MR = MC
- MR < MB = P for all level of output
- Thus monopolist restrict output to $Q^m < Q^*$
- As a result, surplus is not maximized
- A monopolist's price is too high, reducing quantity demanded
- Using market power, the monopolist creates a wedge between consumer willingness to pay and the producer's cost
- A [[deadweight loss]] (DWL) results
