- A consumer derives some benefit from consuming a product
- This benefit is also their willingness to pay (WTP)

[[Total and marginal benefit]]

- Diminishing MB: extra benefit gets smaller the more one consumes a product

[[Individual demand]]

- Purchase up to **P = MB**
- Due to diminishing MB, individual demand is downward sloping

[[The law of demand]]

- The demand curve is derived by assuming that only price and quantity can change
	- If there's change in price/quantity, there will be movement **along** the demand curve, resulting in decrease and increase in the quantity demanded

- If any other relevant factors are changed, this will lead to a change in demand, shifting the demand curve itself

- Market demand: traces out combinations of market price and quantities that all consumers in a market are together willing and able to buy at that price (using horizontal summation)

- [[The law of demand]] also holds for the market demand curve
- Change in the quantity demanded for movement along the curve, change in demand for curve shifts
