A monopoly is an industry comprised of one firm
- No close substitute
- Protected from entrant by barriers

Without close competition, it has market power: the ability to affect price

Perfectly competitive firms are price takers, they don't have power to affect price.

Market power captures the idea that one can increase its price **above the level in a competitive environment** without losing all its customers
