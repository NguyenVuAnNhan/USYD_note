- A firm can enter or exit
- The market will reach its long run equilibrium when firms are making zero economic profits
- A firm will choose to exit the market if its total revenue is less than its total costs 
	- $P < ATC_{MIN}$
- A firm's long run supply curve is the section of its MC that lies above $ATC_{MIN}$

- When firms in the market are profitable ($P > ATC_{MIN}$) firms will want to enter the market
- The entry of more firms into the market will shift the market supply curve to the right, driving the equilibrium price downwards

- When firms in the market are sustaining losses, firms will tend to exit the market
- This pushes the equilibrium price upwards as firms leave the industry

- Price will equal ATC in the long run
- Supply curve cuts the ATC at its minimum, the long-run market price will be $p = ATC_{MIN}$

- If ATC doesn't change in the long run, it's a constant-cost industry. Else, it's a increasing or decreasing cost industry
