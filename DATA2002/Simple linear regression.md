- Aims to predict an outcome variable $Y$, using a single predictor variable x, $$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$$
for $i = 1,2,...,b$ where $n$ is the numbers of observations in the data set. This is just the equation of a straight line plus some additional variation.
- $\beta_0$ is the population intercept parameter
- $\beta_1$ is the population slope parameter
- $\epsilon_i$ is the error term and typically assumed to follow $N(0, \sigma^2)$

Hence, $$Y_i \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i, \sigma^2)$$
