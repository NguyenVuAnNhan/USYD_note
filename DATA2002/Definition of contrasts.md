- A linear combination where the coefficients add to zero

- In an ANOVA context, a contrast is a linear combination of means

- We make the distinction between two kinds of contrast:
	- Population contrasts: contrasts involving the population group means i.e. the $\mu_i$'s
	- Sample contrasts: contrasts involving the sample group means i.e. the $\bar{y}_{i\bullet}$'s and $\bar{Y}_{i\bullet}$'s.

Example:

We consider the population contrast
$$\mu_1 - \mu_2$$
whose corresponding observed sample version is
$$\bar{y}_{1\bullet}-\bar{y}_{2\bullet}$$
which is the observed value of the random variable
$$\bar{Y}_{1\bullet}-\bar{Y}_{2\bullet}$$
