- In some experiments, there is more than one factor that might affect the response
- We can think of such as a big one-way ANOVA where each combination of factors is a different treatment
- Interest lies in determining if there are difference between each treatment but also other questions
	- What factor has an effect?
	- The effect of one factor is the same across all levels of the other factors
- Focus on two factors
