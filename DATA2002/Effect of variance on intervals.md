Our population model is: $$Y = X\beta + \epsilon$$
where $\epsilon \sim N_n(0, \sigma^2)$
1. The smaller the $\sigma^2$, the better the fit and hence the smaller the variances for $\hat{\beta}$ and $\hat{y}_0$
2. The larger the spread of our $x$ variables, the more information we have about how $Y$ responds to each $x$ variable and hence the smaller the variances for $\hat{\beta}$ and $\hat{y}_0$
3. The larger the same size $n$, the smaller the variances for $\hat{\beta}$ and $\hat{y}_0$
4. The closer is $x_0$ to $\bar{x}$ (the component-wise mean of the design matrix), the smaller the variances of $\hat{y}_0$
