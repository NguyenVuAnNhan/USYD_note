- Proportion of variance explained: $$PVE_m = \frac{V_m}{TV}$$
- Choosing the number of PCs that adequately summarizes the variation in $X$, is achieved by examining the cumulative proportion of variance explained.
- Cumulative proportion of variance explained: $$CPVE_k = \sum^k_{m=1}\frac{V_m}{TV}$$
and also by a scree plot
