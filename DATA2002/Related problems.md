You have multivariate variables $x_1,...,x_n$ so $x_1 = (x_{11},...,x_{1p})$
- Find a new set of multivariate that are uncorrelated and explain as much variance as possible
- If you put all the variables together in one matrix, find the best matrix created with fewer variables (lower rank) that explains the original data.

The first goal is statistical, the second is data compression
