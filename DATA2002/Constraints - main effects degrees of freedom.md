- Note that these effects satisfy certain constraints;
- Both set of main effects add to zero $$\sum^{a}_{i=1}\alpha_i = \sum^{b}_{j=1}\gamma_j = 0$$
- There are thus
	- $a - 1$ free $\alpha_i$
	- $b - 1$ free $\gamma_j$
- That is to say there are
	- $a - 1$ degrees of freedom for the factor A main effects
	- $b - 1$ degrees of freedom for the factor B main effects
