- We have observations $$\{y_{ijk}: i = 1,...,a;j=1,...,b;k=1,...,n\}$$
Where $y_{ijk}$ is the k-th observation receiving the treatment combination corresponding to level i of factor A and level j of factor B

- There are n observations receiving each treatment observation
- The full model is that $y_{ijk}$ is the value taken by $Y_{ijk} \sim N(\mu_{ij}, \sigma^2)$
