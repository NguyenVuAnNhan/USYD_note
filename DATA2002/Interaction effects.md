- A similar but more complicated calculation can be used to show that each $(\alpha\gamma)_{ij}$ is also a contrast in the $\mu_{ij}$

- Each $$(\alpha\gamma)_{ij} = \mu_{ij} - (\mu + \alpha_i + \gamma_j)$$
compares a mean $\mu_{ij}$ to the corresponding "additive prediction" $\mu + \alpha_i + \gamma_j$ 

- If the factor levels actually do combine additively, then each such interaction population contrast is zero

- Therefore a "test for no interaction" can be formulated as the following null hypothesis $$H_0: (\alpha\gamma)_{ij} = 0 \text{ for all i, j}$$
