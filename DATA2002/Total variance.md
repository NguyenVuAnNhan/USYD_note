- Total variance in data (assuming variables centered at 0) $$TV = \sum^p_{j=1}Var(x_j) = \sum^p_{j=1}\frac{1}{n}\sum^{n}_{i=1}x^2_{ij}$$
- If variables are standardized, TV = number of variables
- Variance explained by $m$th principal component:
- Variance explained by $m$th principal component:
$$V_m = Var(z_m) = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}z^2_{im}$$
$$TV = \sum^M_{m=1} \text{where M = min}(n-1,p)$$
