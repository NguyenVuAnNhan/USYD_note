We can consider the ratio of variance estimates as a test statistic to test the null hypothesis
$$H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2=...=\mu_g$$
against the alternative that they are not all equal.

The estimate under the null hypothesis is just the combined sample variance
$$\hat{\sigma}^2_0 = \frac{1}{N-1}\sum^{g}_{i=1}\sum^{n_i}_{j=1}(Y_{ij}-\bar{Y}_{\bullet\bullet})^2$$

The estimate under the alternative "full model" is the [[Residual Sum of Squares|Residual Mean Square]]
