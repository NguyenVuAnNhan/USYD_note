- Under the null hypothesis of homogeneity we have $p_{11} = p_{21} \text{ and } p_{12} = p_{22}$ so our best estimate of the proportion in each category is the column total divided by the overall sample size $\hat{p}_{ij} = \frac{y_{\bullet i}}{n}$
- Under $H_0$, the expected counts are $e_{ij} = n_i\hat{p}_{ij} = y_{i\bullet}\frac{y_{\bullet i}}{n}$
