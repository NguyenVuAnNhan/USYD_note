$X$ and $Y$ are said to be independent if $$P(X = x | Y = y) = P(X = x) \text{ or } P(X=x,Y=y) = P(X = x)P(Y = y)$$

In the context of a $2 \cdot 2$ table of proportions,

Let $X$ be a random variable representing survival status and let $Y$ be a random variable representing sex. Under independence, $$p_{11} = P(X = \text{Survive}, Y = \text{Male}) = P(X = \text{Survive})P(Y = \text{Male}) = p_{\bullet 1}p_{1\bullet}$$
