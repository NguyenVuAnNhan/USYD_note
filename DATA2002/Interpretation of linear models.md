$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon$$
- The intercept is the expected value of $Y$ when $x = 0$ i.e. $E(Y|x=0) = \beta_0$
- The slope is the amount we expect $Y$ to change by when $x$ increases on unit

### Interpreting models with log transformations
Log-linear
$$log(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$
On average, a one unit increase in $x$ will result in a $\beta_1 \cdot 100\%$ change in $Y$

Linear-log
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1log(x)$$
On average, a one percent increase in $x$ will result in a $\beta_1/100$ change in $Y$

Log-log
$$log(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1log(x)$$
On average, a one percent increase in $x$ will result in a $\beta_1\%$ change in $Y$
