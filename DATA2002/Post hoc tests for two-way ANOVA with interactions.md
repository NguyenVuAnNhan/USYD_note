- As with any analysis of variance, once we establish that there is something going on, we would like to check what leads to the significance
- However in this two-factor scenario, exactly which comparisons one might be interested in may depend on whether there was a significant interaction or not
- If there is a significant interaction, we might like to know if one factor has a strong effect of the other factor within some or all of its levels
- If there is no significant interaction, the levels of factor A can be compared independently with levels of factor B. We may wish to determine:
	- Which levels of factor A are significantly different from one another
	- Which levels of factor B are significantly different from one another.
- The main thing to realize is that any within-factor comparison is just a contrast in the original $\mu_{ij}$ and so an appropriate multiple comparisons adjustment can be made accordingly
