- Each $\alpha_i$ is in fact a contrast in the treatment combination group means that measures in some overall sense how the means for level i of factor A differ from the overall average

- In exactly the same wat, each $\gamma_j$ is a contrast (in the $\mu_{ij}$) that compares in some overall sense level j of factor B to the overall average
