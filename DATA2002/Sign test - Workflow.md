### Hypothesis

$H_0: p_+ = \frac{1}{2}$ vs $H_1: p_+ > \frac{1}{2}$

### Assumptions
Differences $D_i$ are independent

### Test statistic
Let T be the number of positive differences out of n non-zero differences. Under $H_0$, $T ~ B(n, \frac{1}{2})$. I.e. under $H_0$, T follow a binomial distribution with n = n and p = 0.5

### Observed test statistic
The number of positive differences $t_0$

### p-value
$P(T > t_0)$

### Conclusion
Dependent on the p-value
