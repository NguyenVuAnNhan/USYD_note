Model $y_{ij}$ (for each $j = 1,2,...,n_i$ and $i=1,2,...,g$) as the value taken by a random variable
$$Y_{ij} \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$$
and that all random variables are independent.

Thus we have $g$ different iid samples, the sample for group $i$ (of size $n_i$) being iid $N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$

In other words, for each $i = 1,2,..., g$ , $Y_{i1},..., Y_{in_i}$ are iid $N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$ random variables
