- It is important to check the assumptions underlying the "additive normal model"
- The main things to check are the normality and constant variance assumptions
- This is usually done by
	- Checking that a box plot or normal Q-Q plot for residuals looks normal
	- plotting residuals against fitted values to check the common variance assumption
- Fitted values: $\hat{y}_{ij} = \hat{\mu} + \hat{\alpha}_i + \hat{\beta}_j$
- Residuals: $r_{ij} = y_{ij} - \hat{y}_{ij}$
