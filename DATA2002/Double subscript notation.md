Denote the data with two subscripts:
- $i$ to index the samples
- *j* to index observations within samples

Samples may have different sizes across groups

Let $g$ denote the number of groups

Thus let $y_{ij}$ denote the observation on individual $j$ in the sample for group $i$, $j = 1,2,...,n_i$ and $i = 1,2,...,g$
