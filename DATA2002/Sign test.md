Suppose we get our iid observations from a continuous distribution with mean $\mu$

We want to test $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$

If the distribution is symmetric around $\mu_0$ under $H_0$, then $D_i = X_i - \mu_0$ should be around 0
- $D_i$ equally likely to be positive or negative

If $H_0$ holds then the probability $p_+$ of getting a positive $D_i$ is 0.5

The sign test reduces to a binomial test of proportions

The sign test is non-parametric, relying on only independence and symmetry
