- We may ask many questions about this $\mu_{ij}$
	- $\mu_{ij} = \mu$ (one-way ANOVA between all treatment combination)
	- $\mu_{ij} = \mu_{i}$ (so factor B has no effecct)
	- $\mu_{ij} = \mu_i$

-  Can also ask for interactions:
	- $H_0: \mu_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \gamma_j$ for some constants $\mu, \alpha_i (i=1,...,a), \gamma_j (j=1,...,b)$ so that the two factors combine additively
	- If this is true then the adjustment for each level of factor A is the same within each level of factor B and vice versa
	- If this is not true, then we say there is some interaction between factors A and B
		- Therefore, this is known as a test of no interaction
