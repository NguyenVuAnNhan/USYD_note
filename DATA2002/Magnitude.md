Under the symmetric distribution assumption with mean $\mu_0$ from $H_0$, half of the $d_i = x_i - \mu_0$ should be negative and half positive and the expected counts are both $\frac{n}{2}$

Under the null hypothesis, the positive and negative $d_i$ should occur with roughly similar magnitude and equal probability

If we rank the absolute difference $|d_i|$ in ascending order, the expected rank sums for both negative and positive should be nearly equal
