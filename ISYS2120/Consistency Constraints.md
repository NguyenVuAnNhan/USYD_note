- Add consistency constraints as part of the schema when using CREATE TABLE. Most common consistency constraints are:
	- PRIMARY KEY: Declares an attribute (or several) as the unique identifier for rows in the table.
	- NOT NULL: Forces every row in the table to have a value for this attribute
	- DEFAULT <default_value>: Specify a default value for an attribute
